SOLVER SETTINGS :
   Using fully decomposed Scheme
   Updating Jacobian only locally, whenever possible
   Skipping Newton solution of converged components
   Using COI reference frame
   Variation of x in Jacobian computation : max( 0.1000E-04 |x|, 0.1000E-04)
   Tolerance on network equations in pu (system base) :  0.1000E-02 pu
   Tolerance on injector equations (absolute, relative) :  0.1000E-03 pu,  0.1000E-03 pu
